How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to ensure that your code is functional and secure is to follow the general best practices. For code and code testing, you can ensure it is functional by utilizing things like unit testing, integration testing and system testing.
To ensure security, you can ensure your code is safe by utilizing things like input validation, erorr handling, static code analysis, and etc. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs is an important aspect of creating a program. I interpret user needs by listening or reading what the user is wanting or expecting from a program, and then turning that information into requirements of the software.
For example, for the Contact Service program, the user wanted the ability to manage and store contacts and contact information. This include things like adding or changing first and last names, phone numbers, addresses, etc., and all of those things that they wanted were outlined in the instructions 
for the project. One of the best ways for me to interpret user needs is to create a checklist of things that the user wants, and then go down the list and implement those needs into the program.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by first considering the software requirements. What is the purpose of the software? You have to determine that first before you can even start writing anything. After determining the software requirements, I'll then start writing them down and developing some sort of 
pseudocode, often short-handed, so when I'm writing the actual code, I have a reference point for what that specific line of code is supposed to do. I will generally write the barebones of a class or a function first, and then revise it several times, adding additional things like error handling,
comments, input validation, etc., so that it becomes more robust and functional before moving on to the next item to be developed. Now that I know how to write unit tests, I will also create test classes in tandem with their respective base classes to ensure functionality and security.
